# Getting Started Adventuring

Dear Adventurer,

To start your new quest, type the following command to get going:

```zsh
cargo run data/castle.json
```

The only two commands are `Go <Room Name>` and `Shoot <Room Name>`. If you forget type `help`, but you won't forget, will you?

The aim of the game is to explore the various castle rooms collecting treasure as you go (without dying of course!). To win the game, you ultimately have to shoot the Wumpus before he (or she) gets you! This game is a battle to the death. Be brave!
